OptionsRunner - refreshing the list wth multiple options throws exception ("Already running"),
	and some options don't run.
	Ideally, only refresh the list once ALL refreshing options finish.
	Batch the options, and the listener has a counter. When the options have all been run and/or the
		counter reaches zero, THEN refresh the list.

OptionsTool - copy Option option ;-)

SimpleTerminal
    Add an option to PAUSE when buffer size is exceeded, and show a More button to continue
        Make this the default, and change it for interactive tools, such as Python, Groovy, and plain terminal.

Implement tab completion

Consider letting GrepTask have multiple files instead of just one
    Will need to set the "base" only if there is ONE and it is a directory.

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane

Editor - find (simple non-regex will be good enough to begin with)
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)

Handle exceptions from running options

Position focus when a tab (both kinds) is selected

New Tools :
    PlacesChoices
    Disk usage
    Mount
    Groovy Tools - Lists groovy scripts in a directory, and allows them to be run.

Table Column selection
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27739833/adapt-tableview-menu-button

Editor - Allow listeners when saving the file
    Use it in PlacesTool to refresh the list when editing.





StringListParameter
    trim : Boolean
    removeBlanks : Boolean
    
    Renderes as a TextArea

    Can use this for includes as well as command line options




Listen to the directories on the options path, and clear any cache when a file changes.

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Options which work in the editor
    e.g. remove trailing spaces, convert tabs to spaces
    Expose features throught the "tool", which is in the bindings.

A groovy shell, which has access to the current tool.
    Input may need to be a TextArea to allow for structured code, rather than one liners
        help( object ) gives a list of available properties and methods
        api( object ) opens the javadoc page for that object's class
    Can be a regular HalfTab, but with its own button and shortcut
        If more than one scripting language is available, then use a menubutton thingy (like new tab, new window)

Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Embed a "real" terminal

WebTool open in new tab (right click says "Open in new window) - top level and tool tab!
WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

Use a Property for the tab's text
    Editor adds a "*" without having firing events to listeners
    Ditto for window's title

New toolbar buttons
    Save Project, Load Project
    Settings

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Create tests for GroupParameter duplicates.
    Also need to ensure all existing parameters aren't in an added GroupParameter.

Create tests for ChoiceParameter
    Enum tests

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.

Real terminal emulator

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Full width Inner parameters of a MultipleParameter are not layed out correctly

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========
I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
