Bug
	dt2 and d2 had "difftool\n" and "diff\n" in saved .json file

Multiple parameters not working correctly with expressions

Add a "debug" script to GroovyOption and TaskOption's base class which is run before the option itself is run.
	Maybe call it "pre", to denote it is always run before hand.
	Give a label/description

Add a "debug" flag that GroovyOption / TaskOption / OptionsRunner looks at
	Prints the Option

Need a "CommandOption", which runs a arbitary OS command
	Can't I just use a CommandTask?

FileOptions doesn't know which tool it is for. Therefore we can't get a list of tool specific tasks.

Task names may not be unique, therefore options names won't be unique
	Could add an additional mapping when registering a task
	Could enforce all non-core Tools prefix their options name with an ID e.g. uk.co.nickthecoder.git
		Maybe this could be done automatically by using meta data in the Plugin object.

Switch logic newTab -> sameTab

Split project into sub-projects
	Git is a good first choice. Ahh, but the options .json file!!!	

AddHeaderFooter task
	A single file, or recurse though a directory
	Filter based on extensions
	If file contains the magic phrase, then skip
	otherwise append the given template
	Use it to add GPL headers to all my files.

Bug ExampleTool with only "multiple" the size is full screen height.
	Also gives the wrong size for multiple when first prompting programming of directory!

Editor - find (simple non-regex will be good enough to begin with)
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)


Maybe I should rename Task to Command and Command to OSCommand???
	TaskDescription becomes CommandDescription
	In which case, the project needs to be renamed. Ouch!

Given that many options which return Tools are newTab, maybe I need a way to override this.
	function which have newTab : Boolean become newTab : Boolean?
	Do something similar for prompt? So you could default "rm" to prompt, but override by holding down shift.

DateParameter
	Use it on GitLogTool

Port the directory listening code from wrkfoo, so that DirectoryTool and DirectoryTreeTool can update

SimpleTerminal
    Add an option to PAUSE when buffer size is exceeded, and show a More button to continue
	Hmm, this would only make sense if it pause per-screenful, like the more command.
        Make this the default, and change it for interactive tools, such as Python, Groovy, and plain terminal.

Implement command line tab completion

Consider letting GrepTask have multiple files instead of just one
    Will need to set the "base" only if there is ONE and it is a directory.

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane

New Tools :
    PlacesChoices
    Groovy Tools - Lists groovy scripts in a directory, and allows them to be run.

Table Column selection
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27739833/adapt-tableview-menu-button

Editor - Allow listeners when saving the file
    Use it in PlacesTool to refresh the list when editing.





StringListParameter
    trim : Boolean
    removeBlanks : Boolean
    
    Renderes as a TextArea

    Can use this for includes as well as command line options




Listen to the directories on the options path, and clear any cache when a file changes.

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Embed a "real" terminal

WebTool open in new tab (right click says "Open in new window) - top level and tool tab!
WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Full width Inner parameters of a MultipleParameter are not layed out correctly

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
