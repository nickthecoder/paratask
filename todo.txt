Implement duplicate in Tool and Task
    Use it when splitting
    Add duplicate tab feature

    TerminalTool current has arguments in its constructor
    
    

Create a ListTool

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

Use a Property for the tab's text
    Editor adds a "*" without having firing events to listeners
    Ditto for window's title

SimpleTerminal to close the input before killing the process

Use ButtonBar for TaskPrompter (orders the buttons in an OS specific manner)

Create a toolbar
    Duplicate Tab
    Save Project, Load Project
    Settings
Per Half-Tab toolbar :
    Re-run/stop, ToolMenu, Back Forwards, Close

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Create tests for GroupParameter duplicates.
    Also need to ensure all existing parameters aren't in an added GroupParameter.

Create tests for ChoiceParameter
    Enum tests

Beep when run/apply clicked, but there's an error?
            
Tasks can implement a Toolable interface, which allows the command line to run as a Tool.
    So GrepTask is Toolable, and can return a TerminalTool for itself.
    Also GrepParser is Toolable and returns a GrepTool, which is a ListTool

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.

Bugs
====

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace ;-(
