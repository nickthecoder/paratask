Add a Help/About button to the main toolbar
Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

Use a Property for the tab's text
    Editor adds a "*" without having firing events to listeners
    Ditto for window's title

SimpleTerminal to close the input before killing the process

Create a ListTool

Create a toolbar
    Save Project, Load Project
    Settings
Per Half-Tab toolbar :
    ToolMenu, Back Forwards, Close

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Create tests for GroupParameter duplicates.
    Also need to ensure all existing parameters aren't in an added GroupParameter.

Create tests for ChoiceParameter
    Enum tests

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.


Bugs
====

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace ;-(

Hard Bugs
=========
I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
