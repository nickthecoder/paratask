Use options from the jar file, so that it works "out of the box"
    // TODO Are we reliant on listing a directory for the options to work?

Tools to have a "long" label, which is displayed in the window title bar
	Implement as a Property, so that Tools don't need to inform when the longLabel changes.

Cannot launch "paratask --prompt paratack", as it tries to start JavaFX twice.

Use Resource for Places?

Editor - find and replace
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)

Implement command line tab completion

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)


A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
