Editor - find (simple non-regex will be good enough to begin with)
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)

Switch logic newTab -> sameTab?

Given that many options which return Tools are newTab, maybe I need a way to override this.
	function which have newTab : Boolean become newTab : Boolean?
	Do something similar for prompt? So you could default "rm" to prompt, but override by holding down shift.

DateParameter
	Use it on GitLogTool

Port the directory listening code from wrkfoo, so that DirectoryTool and DirectoryTreeTool can update

SimpleTerminal
    Add an option to PAUSE when buffer size is exceeded, and show a More button to continue
	Hmm, this would only make sense if it pause per-screenful, like the more command.
        Make this the default, and change it for interactive tools, such as Python, Groovy, and plain terminal.

Implement command line tab completion

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)


Table Column selection

Editor - Allow listeners when saving the file
    Use it in PlacesTool to refresh the list when editing.


Directory Listener
    Listen to the directories on the options path, and clear any cache when a file changes.
    Editor to offer "reload" when a file is touched
    Directory and Places, PlacesDirectory update themselves when a directory changes.

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Embed a "real" terminal

WebTool open in new tab (right click says "Open in new window) - top level and tool tab!
WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
