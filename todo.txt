Create a ListTool

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

Create a toolbar
    Quit, New Window, Duplicate Tab
    Split V, Split H, Unsplit
    New Tab
    Save Project, Load Project
    Settings
Per Half-Tab toolbar :
    Re-run/stop, Home, Back Forwards, Close

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Create tests for GroupParameter duplicates.
    Also need to ensure all existing parameters aren't in an added GroupParameter.

Create tests for ChoiceParameter
    Enum tests

Beep when run/apply clicked, but there's an error?
            
Tasks can implement a Toolable interface, which allows the command line to run as a Tool.
    So GrepTask is Toolable, and can return a TerminalTool for itself.
    Also GrepParser is Toolable and returns a GrepTool, which is a ListTool

    
Bugs
====

    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace ;-(
