Create a Grep tool, where the ouput is part of the GUI
    Parameter option to choose what to do with the output of the command
        Pass Through (will show in terminal calling GrepTask)
        New Window
        Tabbed ( in a window, but keep multiple copies of the command output)
        Attached ( connected to the TaskPrompter window)
        Attached Tabbed ( as above, but keep multiple copies of the command output )
            Could use accordian, with the command line as the "tab".

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Unfurl groups if the child has an error

TaskPrompter to show running tasks, and allow them to be killed
    "OK" button hides the parameters section, and ONLY shows the "Running" section

Bugs
====

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace ;-(

Ending a form with a GroupParameter, the scrollbars don't kick in soon enough.
    May be due to "padding" merging? and the box doesn't count as content.
