Use LinkedMap for parameter collections, such as Group

Think about how a Task should handle its parameter values while running
    They could change halfway through the task's execution!

    Allow parameter to become temporarily FIXED (Forms all ParameterMetaListener and will grey out controls)

    Maybe Task should be broken in two. One part has the parameters, and can be prompted etc.
        The other half is a Runnable, and you can choose a flexible Runnable with pre/post, and a plain one.

    Maybe Task should have a factory method to create the Runnable
        That would allow the factory to return "this" to mimic the old design
        This may help when creating threaded/unthreaded tools in wrkfoo

    Task can become an interface, and a CommandLineTask can have additional properties :
        command name
        description (used for --help text only)
