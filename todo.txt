Tools with directories should default to "."
	When running options, resolve all FileParameters based on :
		The tool's directory is it is HasDirectory
		The current working directory otherwise.
	There is a more generic version of this... What about the current database, current DB table etc.

TerminalTool to allow running of Tasks/Tools/Options from the input field

TerminalTool to keep track of the current directory by parsing the output, looking for a special PS1
	Only do this if running bash/sh?

Write a DB tool
	Work with Tables
	Work with Users
	Work with Rows
Ideally, it would work with at least MariaDB/MySQL, SQLLite and Progres

BUG: Cannot launch "paratask --prompt paratack", as it tries to start JavaFX twice.

Use Resource for Places? Looks good! Resource can have the "icon" stuff in it.
	Maybe use a different icon for file,directory,jar,other

Editor - find and replace
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)

Implement command line tab completion

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)


A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
