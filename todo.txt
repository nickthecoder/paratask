ListTask - does it do anything?

AllOptionsTool
    Can filter by a single path
    
OptionsTool
    also has :
        IncluesTool
    Mybe use a TabPane, with tabs at the bottom "Options", "Includes"

    Create a SharedToolPane implementation, which forwards method calls to the 'parent'

Implement FileParameter properly

Port FileLister to Kotlin

ToolRunner to prevent a Tool being run while it is already running

OptionsRunner should only refresh the results ONCE when many options are run at once.

We have two Column classes. Rename one!

StringListParameter
    trim : Boolean
    removeBlanks : Boolean
    
    Renderes as a TextArea

    Will use this for includes as well as command line options

    
Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Remove Results.chooseFocus

WebTool opten in new tab (right click says "Open in new window)

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

Simple Text Editor

Use a Property for the tab's text
    Editor adds a "*" without having firing events to listeners
    Ditto for window's title

New toolbar buttons
    Save Project, Load Project
    Settings

Create tests for BooleanParameter and BooleanField

Create tests for GroupParameter duplicates.
    Also need to ensure all existing parameters aren't in an added GroupParameter.

Create tests for ChoiceParameter
    Enum tests

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.

Real terminal emulator

Bugs
====

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace ;-(

Hard Bugs
=========
I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
