FileOperations
	Make file dialog pretier
	Report errors
	Include a cancel button
	Progress bar
	Allow ctrl+C and ctrl+V to copy files from one DirectoryTool to another.
	And ctrl+X/ctrl+V to move files

Drag & Drop on major tabs
	Can't there is no way to drag and drop onto a tab, as it doesn't expose the Tab as a node. Grr.
	Do I really have to implement my own TabPane? 

Implement MythTool using the service API, not using the DB directly
	Can't get my myth server to listen on anything except localhost. Grrr.

Drag an drop options
	Make a generic base class for DragFiles and DropFiles
	Only useful once drag and drop is allowed on a TabPane's Tab, which isn't possible. Grr.

Bug. FileField is one behind on the updates when typing filenames.

Bug. Adding an include to an empty options file threw an expection

Implement command line tab completion

Make git diff its own command (with boolean for Use Diff Tool)
	Allow for changes between various "positions" e.g. HEAD, MASTER, a stash, a commit etc.
		Maybe even create special Parameters for the "positions"
			A button to pop-up a list of stashes, commits etc.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7677736/git-diff-against-a-stash

Task to extract options from the jar file, and place them into ~/.config/paratask/options
	(Don't overwrite anything, unless the "overwrite" parameter is ticked.

---

Non-Row Options to have a shortcut
	For example, Alt+UP on a directory based tool runs the "^" option.
	e.g. ctrl+P to Push from GitTool ctrl+O to check Out ctrl+A check out All etc.

Pipeline - As well as "Script", "Task", can also be a Pipeline
	A list of Tasks/Tools/Scripts?
		e.g. Command | Editor
		GitLog | FilterRow | Table ( GitLog )
		ListDirectory | ForEach?? | SearchAndReplace

Expressions to allow for autocomplete.
	e.g. row. should autocomplete all public methods/attributes

Check if Places updates across NFS, if not remove FileWatcher, and replace with Options.refresh

Running slow tasks such as GitCommittedFiles needs to give feedback that the option IS running.

Need some way to "hide" weird options such as "GC", printRow etc.
	Maybe have an "order", and when N options are in the menu, then place the less used options in a sub-menu.

TerminalTool to allow running of Tasks/Tools/Options from the input field
	Special prefix such as ":" to specify an option, and allow for simple command line style arguments

A true tree style tool would be interesting.
	Not only to implement DirecoryTree properly, but also for unrelated items in the tree
		e.g. Place -> directory -> file ( each with different option files )

Sidebar - A tool which appears on the left, not within a major tab,
	Places is the obvious one, bu Directory and DirectoryTree may be useful too,

TerminalTool to keep track of the current directory by parsing the output, looking for a special PS1

TerminalTool : Store history of command issued.

TerminalTool : Tab-complete
	Maybe use Alt+DOWN, for consistancy with FileParameter
	Also, allow files to be dragged to the input field to add them as arguments


Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.


Later Version
=============

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)


Terminal isn't HasDirectory yet

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(


Write a DB tool
	Work with Tables
	Work with Users
	Work with Rows
Ideally, it would work with at least MariaDB/MySQL, SQLLite and Progres


Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
