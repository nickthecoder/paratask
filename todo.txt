TODO

New minor tab : Columns : Reorder and select columns for table tools.
	Should these be saved to history?
	Must be saved to project file.

Sort out the options path.
	Is the jar file going to be used, or a directory in the app's path?
	Resources to have "isWritable" and use it to filter the options when editing options.

Bugs
	Right click on a row without the code having focus puts the menu on the far right of the row.

When loading a project, collect errors, and show them in a new tab.

Add more filters to the find tool

Ctrl+A selects all rows in the table, copying the current row's code.
De-selecting a row removes that row's code (if it has one).

OptionsTool to list other options paths which have a FileOption with this name.
	As a new minor tab. Only show it if it isn't empty???

COPY Drag of Files to the same directory make a COPY of the files.
	Maybe ask first? To prevent accidental drags screwing things up.


Use Kotlin scripts instead of Groovy scripts.
	Implement it side by side, then add "deprecation" warning when loading groovy scripts, then remove groovy completely.
	Its slowwwww! I don't know how/if it is possible to compile the script and re-use the compiled version. Hmmm.
		I will stick with Groovy for now - Scripts aren't used much anyway, as *  Tasks* are used for most options.

Dialog box to ask if Editor's buffers should be saved
	All operations that may close/detach a tab must do so via a "confirmDetatch" method (not specific to Editor).
	If any of the tools require confirmation, then the action isn't performed until the confirmation dialog is "Ok"ed.
	The action is in the window title bar. e.g. "Close Tab", "Merge Tabs", "Close Right Panel"
	Each has a special BooleanParameter, with a label such as "Save todo.txt", which defaults to true.
		Has a tooltip (description) which shows the full path of the file to save/discard when you hover over the checkbox's label.
	Ok, sends results to the Tool, which then saves/discards depending on the value of the special boolean
		The operation is then executed.
	Cancel sends nothing, and abandons the operation.
	Closing a whole Project window may yield MANY questions, in which case, show them in GROUPS (GroupParameter)
		If every group has only ONE question, then we don't need to show as groups.

FileOperations
	Report errors
	Include a cancel button
	Inlucde a pause button. Pause the thread AND the process
	Allow ctrl+C  / ctrl+X and ctrl+V to copy/move files from one DirectoryTool to another.
		Implement as options when rows have shortcuts?
		Or maybe use the Drag/Drop infrastructure, which may allow copy/paste of other types of data, such as Places.

Allowing GroupParameter and/or CompoundParameter to lay out children using a FlowPane / GridPane / HBox.
	Could use it for ShortcutParameter's booleans and maybe EditOptionTask's booleans too.
	The children would need to SHARE one error message label.

Space out the ScaleDouble fields.

Fix problem where changing ScaledValue elements doesn't fire change events. Hmmm.
	Add a ScaledDoubleParameter on ScaledValue, and throw exception if a value is used by more than one parameter.
	Or add a list of ScaledDoubleParameters???
	Or make ScaledValue imutable???

Implement MythTool using the service API, not using the DB directly
	Can't get my myth server to listen on anything except localhost. Grrr.
	Maybe put it in a different (sub) project, as it is by no means a core feature.

Implement command line tab completion

Make git diff its own Task (with boolean for Use Diff Tool)
	Allow for changes between various "positions" e.g. HEAD, MASTER, a stash, a commit etc.
		Maybe even create special Parameters for the "positions"
			A button to pop-up a list of stashes, commits etc.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7677736/git-diff-against-a-stash

Task to extract options from the jar file, and place them into ~/.config/paratask/options
	(Don't overwrite anything, unless the "overwrite" parameter is ticked.


PasswordParameter - never saved in json
	But maybe later retrieve password values from a password safe.
	So the parameter has an option to TYPE the password OR specify the key in the password safe.
	For extra flexibility, support multiple password safes (each with their own parameters).

New Tasks
	Audio tasks
		Encode a file to mp3/ogg/flac etc
		Tag the file
	mmv (multiple move) - Is this already done?

New Tools
	ufw (uncomplicated firewall) GUI Front end

---

Pipeline - As well as "Script", "Task", can also be a Pipeline
	A list of Tasks/Tools/Scripts?
		e.g. Command | Editor
		GitLog | FilterRow | Table ( GitLog )
		ListDirectory | ForEach?? | SearchAndReplace

Expressions to allow for autocomplete.
	e.g. row. should autocomplete all public methods/attributes

Need some way to "hide" weird options such as "GC", printRow etc.
	Maybe have an "order", and when N options are in the menu, then place the less used options in a sub-menu.

TerminalTool to allow running of Tasks/Tools/Options from the input field
	Special prefix such as ":" to specify an option, and allow for simple command line style arguments

A true tree style tool would be interesting.
	Not only to implement DirecoryTree properly, but also for unrelated items in the tree
		e.g. Place -> directory -> file ( each with different option files )

Sidebar - A tool which appears on the left, not within a major tab,
	Places is the obvious one, bu Directory and DirectoryTree may be useful too,

TerminalTool to keep track of the current directory by parsing the output, looking for a special PS1

TerminalTool : Store history of command issued.

TerminalTool : Tab-complete
	Maybe use Alt+DOWN, for consistancy with FileParameter
	Also, allow files to be dragged to the input field to add them as arguments


Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.


Later Version
=============

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)

Terminal isn't HasDirectory yet

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(


Write a generic DB tool
	Work with Tables
	Work with Users
	Work with Rows
Ideally, it would work with at least MariaDB/MySQL, SQLLite and ProgresSql


Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
