Parameter.createField returns a field still!
	GroupField HAS a parametersForm rather than subclassing it.
		It is not a LabelledField, and therefore is left aligned.
	MultipleParmeter returns a MultipleField which IS a LabelledField, and the "main" contol is a parmaetersForm
	OneOfParameter return a OneOfField, which has a ParametersForm, with only one element.

OneOf isn't a sub class of GroupParameter - it should share a abstract base class
	createField and buildContent are not inherrited by OneOf

Do something about GrepTask/GrepTool
	The moreFilesP and moreMatchesP are clearly bodges. Need something better than that!
	MultipleParameter must be HeaderRow friendly!

MultipleParameter.expression should check for a list, and add all elements


Tool.autoRun isn't really being used.
Also, prompt isn't being respected - tools are run, without their parameters being shown

GrepTool to show the command line.

Work on Keyboard Focus
	Have a ProjectShortcutManager
		Next/Prev major tab	: ctrl + PageUp, PageDown - May be tricky as the minor tabs will steal this!
		Next/Prev minor tab	: ctrl + shift + PageUp, PageDown
		Major Tab #n		: ctrl + 1..9
		Minor Tab #n		: shift+ctrl + 1..9. Also F9 for Parameters
		Left/Right Half Tab	: ctrl + { }
		Non-Row Options Field   : F10
	Each of these actions changes the focus to the appropriate Results (or parameters)
	To ensure that the shortcuts always work, put them ALL at the top level
		Things such as F5 will need a findHalfTab()?.tool.refresh
			Where findHalfTab() will return a HalfTab unless there is none.
	Allow each action to have multiple shortcuts, so that it can avoid WindowManage clashes without users customising the shortcuts

	New Toolbar button to launch a web page containing the keyboard shortcuts

	Running Options
		Enter for default behaviour
		Double click to run the default option
		F6 to prompt
		"ctrl" to force a new Tab - this doesn't work well with double click though.
			Maybe double click shouldn't allow any modifications ???
			As JavaFX doesn't seem to support middle click for paste, perhaps use double middle click
		"shift+ctrl" to force the same tab???

Create a Tool to edit keyboard shortcuts
	Must keep the defaults, and only save those that are different.
		Action to have "var userShortcut : KeyCombination?"	
	Don't worry if tooltips don't get updated till a restart/new window.

Add a "debug" script to TaskOption which is run before the option itself is run.
	Funny... The easiest way to do this is to merge GroovyOption and TaskOption!
		Simpler, better
			Does away with lots of "ifs"
			No need for clunky "OneOfParameter"
			

Add a "debug" flag that GroovyOption / TaskOption / OptionsRunner looks at
	Prints the Option


FileOptions doesn't know which tool it is for. Therefore we can't get a list of tool specific tasks.

Task names may not be unique, therefore options names won't be unique
	Could add an additional mapping when registering a task
	Could enforce all non-core Tools prefix their options name with an ID e.g. uk.co.nickthecoder.git
		Maybe this could be done automatically by using meta data in the Plugin object.

Switch logic newTab -> sameTab

Split project into sub-projects
	Git is a good first choice. Ahh, but the options .json file!!!	

AddHeaderFooter task
	A single file, or recurse though a directory
	Filter based on extensions
	If file contains the magic phrase, then skip
	otherwise append the given template
	Use it to add GPL headers to all my files.

Bug ExampleTool with only "multiple" the size is full screen height.
	Also gives the wrong size for multiple when first prompting programming of directory!

Editor - find (simple non-regex will be good enough to begin with)
    Editor to work with grep to highlight matches (using regex and fixed patterns)


Maybe I should rename Task to Command and Command to OSCommand???
	TaskDescription becomes CommandDescription
	In which case, the project needs to be renamed. Ouch!

Given that many options which return Tools are newTab, maybe I need a way to override this.
	function which have newTab : Boolean become newTab : Boolean?
	Do something similar for prompt? So you could default "rm" to prompt, but override by holding down shift.

DateParameter
	Use it on GitLogTool

Port the directory listening code from wrkfoo, so that DirectoryTool and DirectoryTreeTool can update

SimpleTerminal
    Add an option to PAUSE when buffer size is exceeded, and show a More button to continue
	Hmm, this would only make sense if it pause per-screenful, like the more command.
        Make this the default, and change it for interactive tools, such as Python, Groovy, and plain terminal.

Implement command line tab completion

Consider letting GrepTask have multiple files instead of just one
    Will need to set the "base" only if there is ONE and it is a directory.

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane

New Tools :
    PlacesChoices
    Groovy Tools - Lists groovy scripts in a directory, and allows them to be run.

Table Column selection
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27739833/adapt-tableview-menu-button

Editor - Allow listeners when saving the file
    Use it in PlacesTool to refresh the list when editing.





StringListParameter
    trim : Boolean
    removeBlanks : Boolean
    
    Renderes as a TextArea

    Can use this for includes as well as command line options




Listen to the directories on the options path, and clear any cache when a file changes.

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Add optional help button to TaskPrompter and ParametersPane (if TaskDescription has a help address)

Embed a "real" terminal

WebTool open in new tab (right click says "Open in new window) - top level and tool tab!
WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

Task and Tool are in two different packages. Should they be?

ProjectWindow to detach all tabs when it is closed
    (so that terminals and other tools can clean up)

WebTool to allow for multiple web pages.

FocusListener to use weak refs, so that if the resources are gc'd, then it can remove itself.

Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.

Full width Inner parameters of a MultipleParameter are not layed out correctly

A collapsed groups must unfurl when a child has an error
    Add a listener in GroupField
    That won't handle custom errors, only Parameter's built in validation

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(

Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
