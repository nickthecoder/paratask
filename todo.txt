Search for KeyCodeCombination and put them ALL in ParaTaskActions

Consider VISIBILITY event being sent to the parameter, not its parent.

Bugs
	Memory leak when CLOSING tabs.
		Changing tools doesn't leak.
	Drag and Drop url places doesn't do anything, but suggests it will!
		I haven't coded drag and drop for Resources :-(
	Adding an include to an empty options file threw an expection

	Cannot resize "Places" column widths

Remember closed tabs, so that they can be re-opened using ctrl+shift+T

MyTabPane to have ability to have a "+" button on the right to add a new tab.
	It is up to the client to determine what happens when the button is clicked.
	In ParaTask, open "Home", in KoGo, also open "Home"
		Can then allow the Home tab to be closed.

Allowing GroupParameter and/or CompoundParameter to lay out children using a FlowPane / GridPane / HBox.
	Could use it for ShortcutParameter's booleans and maybe EditOptionTask's booleans too.
	The children would need to SHARE one error message label.

Space out the ScaleDouble fields.

Consider reversing the key/value pairs of ScaledDoubleParameter's scales.

Fix problem where changing ScaledValue elements doesn't fire change events. Hmmm.
	Add a ScaledDoubleParameter on ScaledValue, and throw exception if a value is used by more than one parameter.
	Or add a list of ScaledDoubleParameters???
	Or make ScaledValue imutable???
	

FileOperations
	Make file dialog pretier
	Report errors
	Include a cancel button
	Progress bar
	Allow ctrl+C and ctrl+V to copy files from one DirectoryTool to another.
	And ctrl+X/ctrl+V to move files

I think I'm using Drag/DropFiles source incorrectly.
	If I set it to the parent directory for DirectoryTool, to PlacesFile for PlacesTool and the TextField for FileField
	Then the DropFiles need to perform a custom check.

Implement MythTool using the service API, not using the DB directly
	Can't get my myth server to listen on anything except localhost. Grrr.

Implement command line tab completion

Make git diff its own command (with boolean for Use Diff Tool)
	Allow for changes between various "positions" e.g. HEAD, MASTER, a stash, a commit etc.
		Maybe even create special Parameters for the "positions"
			A button to pop-up a list of stashes, commits etc.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7677736/git-diff-against-a-stash

Task to extract options from the jar file, and place them into ~/.config/paratask/options
	(Don't overwrite anything, unless the "overwrite" parameter is ticked.

New Tasks
	ImageMagick tasks
		Resize
	Audio tasks
		Encode a file to mp3/ogg/flac etc
		Tag the file
	mmv (multiple move) - Is this already done?

New Tools
	ufw (uncomplicated firewall) GUI Front end

---

Pipeline - As well as "Script", "Task", can also be a Pipeline
	A list of Tasks/Tools/Scripts?
		e.g. Command | Editor
		GitLog | FilterRow | Table ( GitLog )
		ListDirectory | ForEach?? | SearchAndReplace

Expressions to allow for autocomplete.
	e.g. row. should autocomplete all public methods/attributes

Check if Places updates across NFS, if not remove FileWatcher, and replace with Options.refresh

Running slow tasks such as GitCommittedFiles needs to give feedback that the option IS running.

Need some way to "hide" weird options such as "GC", printRow etc.
	Maybe have an "order", and when N options are in the menu, then place the less used options in a sub-menu.

TerminalTool to allow running of Tasks/Tools/Options from the input field
	Special prefix such as ":" to specify an option, and allow for simple command line style arguments

A true tree style tool would be interesting.
	Not only to implement DirecoryTree properly, but also for unrelated items in the tree
		e.g. Place -> directory -> file ( each with different option files )

Sidebar - A tool which appears on the left, not within a major tab,
	Places is the obvious one, bu Directory and DirectoryTree may be useful too,

TerminalTool to keep track of the current directory by parsing the output, looking for a special PS1

TerminalTool : Store history of command issued.

TerminalTool : Tab-complete
	Maybe use Alt+DOWN, for consistancy with FileParameter
	Also, allow files to be dragged to the input field to add them as arguments


Bugs
====

Editor must not re-load existing files when re-running the tool.


Later Version
=============

Editor - Open a file in a new lower tab
    Can we remove a single lower tab?
        When removing the last editor tab, remove the whole toolPane
    Allow a single Editor tool to be reused
	i.e. When opening a new text file, if there is already an Editor open, then use it, adding a new minor tab
	    (or showing the minor tab if it is already open)

Terminal isn't HasDirectory yet

A "lazy" terminal tool, only adds itself to the GUI if the command returns output.

Delete the 1 from "100" in a spinner throws. My code isn't in the stack trace :-(


Write a generic DB tool
	Work with Tables
	Work with Users
	Work with Rows
Ideally, it would work with at least MariaDB/MySQL, SQLLite and ProgresSql


Hard Bugs
=========

I've tried to fix them, but have not found a solution.

WebTool does not detect when a redirect occurs.
    This puts TWO moments in the history (one for the address requested and another for the redirected address).
    When in the middle of History this second one wipes out the future history.
